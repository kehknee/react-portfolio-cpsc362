            </h1>
            <p>
                My name is Kenny, and I'm a computer scientist. I'm new to software engineering
                and I hope I can expand my knowledge. I am looking for a role in cyber security
                or game development. I would also be interested in any internships as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am confident in my abilities to work well with others, provide good results
                in ample time, and my willingness to learn new things. I have a deep hobby in
                gaming, keyboard building, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below you can find any projects that I have or am working on.
                *Currently, there are none but I plan to add many more in the future!*
